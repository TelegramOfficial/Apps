**Source code**

For the moment we are focusing on open sourcing the things that allow developers to quickly build something using our API. We have published the code for our Android, iOS, web and desktop apps (Win, macOS and Linux) as well as the Telegram Database Library.

> This code allows security researchers to fully evaluate our [end-to-end encryption implementation](). It is also possible to independently verify that Telegram apps available on Google Play and App Store are built using the [same code]() that we publish on GitHub.
